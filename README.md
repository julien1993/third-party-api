# Using a third party API practice exercise

This project take in a postcode in an input field and returns to the user a JSON object of information about the entered UK postcode using the Postcodes.io API. It also take some specific data from the JSON file (the nhs and parliamentary constituency) and displays them separately. This project uses an AJAX request to do so. 

In the future I will apply styling to this website to make it more attractive and have plans to link to another third party API which will tell you about the weather in the postcode that the user entered.
